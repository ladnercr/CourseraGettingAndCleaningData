## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

### Project Files
* ReadMe.md - explains the analysis files.
* CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that                   were performed to clean up the data.
* run_analysis.R - does the following:
    * 1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * 2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for                             each measurement.
    * 3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * 4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * 5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



### Instructions
* Download the run_analysis.R file.
* Execute the scripts.
* Use the CodeBook.md file to interpret the results of the Dataset.
